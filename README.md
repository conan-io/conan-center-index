Conan Center Index is the source index of recipes of the [ConanCenter](https://conan.io/center) package repository for [Conan](https://conan.io).

This repository includes a Continuous Integration system that will build automatically the Conan packages for the recipes submitted via
[Pull Request](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/pulls).

### Add ConanCenter remote

ConanCenter remote is configured by default in any Conan client installation. If, for any reason, you need to add it manually, just execute:

```
conan remote add conancenter https://center.conan.io
```

### How to consume recipes

Starting to use recipes from this repository is as easy as running
one simple command after installing Conan:

```
conan install name/version@ [-g <generator>]
```

Of course, we really encourage you to use a `conanfile.txt` or `conanfile.py`
to list all the requirements or your project and install them all together
(Conan will build a single graph and ensure congruency).

:warning: It is very important to notice that recipes will evolve over time
and, while they are fixing some issues, they might introduce new features and
improvements, and your project can break if you upgrade them
([How to prevent these breaking changes in my project?](docs/consuming_recipes.md)).
