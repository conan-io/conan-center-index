&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.&nbsp; This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.&nbsp; If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.&nbsp; The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp; If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp; A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.&nbsp; This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.&nbsp; In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp; A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp; The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp; Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp; If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.&nbsp; (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp; You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp; If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp; If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.&nbsp; If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp; Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp; However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.&nbsp; These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp; You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp; If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp; For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp; The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp; For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).&nbsp; To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp; The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.&nbsp; However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program.&nbsp; If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;program&gt;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>

&nbsp; The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.&nbsp; But first, please read<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.&nbsp; It also counts<br>
&nbsp;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
&nbsp;the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.&nbsp; You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.&nbsp; These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.&nbsp; If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.&nbsp; Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.&nbsp; We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.&nbsp; Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.&nbsp; This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&nbsp; We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.&nbsp; The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.&nbsp; The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.&nbsp; It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.&nbsp; These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.&nbsp; However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.&nbsp; To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.&nbsp; A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&nbsp; In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.&nbsp; For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.&nbsp; Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".&nbsp; The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.&nbsp; A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).&nbsp; Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application.&nbsp; Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&nbsp; To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.&nbsp; (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)&nbsp; Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".&nbsp; Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".&nbsp; The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&nbsp; The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.&nbsp; (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.&nbsp; You must supply a copy of this License.&nbsp; If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.&nbsp; Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; executable containing the modified Library.&nbsp; (It is understood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.&nbsp; However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.&nbsp; Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.&nbsp; However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.&nbsp; You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&nbsp; It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the GNU<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&nbsp; This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.&nbsp; (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.&nbsp; If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp; The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute corresponding source code.&nbsp; (This alternative is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.&nbsp; However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE<br>

&nbsp; 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year&nbsp; name of author<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
&nbsp; `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
&nbsp;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.&nbsp; It is<br>
&nbsp;numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.&nbsp; You can use it for<br>
your libraries, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.&nbsp; If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
library.&nbsp; If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>
the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
transforming the program into proprietary software.&nbsp; To prevent this,<br>
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.&nbsp; This<br>
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
designated libraries.&nbsp; This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>
the same as in the ordinary license.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>
program and simply using it.&nbsp; Linking a program with a library, without<br>
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>
analogous to running a utility program or application program.&nbsp; However, in<br>
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>
treats it as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.&nbsp; We<br>
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
libraries themselves.&nbsp; This Library General Public License is intended to<br>
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>
libraries that are incorporated in them.&nbsp; (We have not seen how to achieve<br>
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)&nbsp; The hope is that this<br>
will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.&nbsp; Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".&nbsp; The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>
works together with the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
General Public License (also called "this License").&nbsp; Each licensee is<br>
addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.&nbsp; A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).&nbsp; Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application.&nbsp; Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&nbsp; To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.&nbsp; (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)&nbsp; Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".&nbsp; Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".&nbsp; The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&nbsp; The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.&nbsp; (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.&nbsp; You must supply a copy of this License.&nbsp; If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.&nbsp; Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; executable containing the modified Library.&nbsp; (It is understood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.&nbsp; However, as a special exception,<br>
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.&nbsp; Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.&nbsp; However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.&nbsp; You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&nbsp; It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the GNU<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License along with this library; if not, write to the Free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MA 02110-1301, USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
&nbsp; library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Additional Definitions. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.&nbsp; The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.&nbsp; You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.<br>

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION<br>
<br>
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this<br>
license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional<br>
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version<br>
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that<br>
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that<br>
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.<br>
<br>
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of<br>
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled<br>
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of<br>
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the<br>
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.<br>
<br>
0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime<br>
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an<br>
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based<br>
on the Runtime Library.<br>
<br>
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without<br>
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of<br>
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any<br>
subsequent versions published by the FSF.<br>
<br>
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,<br>
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with<br>
the license of GCC.<br>
<br>
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual<br>
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for<br>
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution<br>
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any<br>
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used<br>
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.<br>
<br>
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in<br>
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in<br>
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,<br>
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered<br>
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be<br>
understood as starting with the output of the generators or<br>
preprocessors.<br>
<br>
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or<br>
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any<br>
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to<br>
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an<br>
Eligible Compilation Process.<br>
<br>
1. Grant of Additional Permission.<br>
<br>
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by<br>
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such<br>
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that<br>
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You<br>
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,<br>
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.<br>
<br>
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.<br>
<br>
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general<br>
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft<br>
requirements of the license of GCC.<br>
<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.&nbsp; This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.&nbsp; If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.&nbsp; The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp; If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp; A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.&nbsp; This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.&nbsp; In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp; A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp; The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp; Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp; If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.&nbsp; (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp; You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp; If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp; If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.&nbsp; If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp; Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp; However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.&nbsp; These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp; You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp; If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp; For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp; The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp; For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).&nbsp; To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp; The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.&nbsp; However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program.&nbsp; If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;program&gt;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.&nbsp; But first, please read<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&nbsp; This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.&nbsp; (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.&nbsp; If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp; The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute corresponding source code.&nbsp; (This alternative is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.&nbsp; However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year&nbsp; name of author<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br>

&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.&nbsp; It also counts<br>
&nbsp;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
&nbsp;the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.&nbsp; You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations<br>
below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.&nbsp; These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.&nbsp; If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.&nbsp; Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.&nbsp; We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.&nbsp; Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.&nbsp; This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&nbsp; We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.&nbsp; The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.&nbsp; The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.&nbsp; It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.&nbsp; These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.&nbsp; However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it<br>
becomes a de-facto standard.&nbsp; To achieve this, non-free programs must<br>
be allowed to use the library.&nbsp; A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&nbsp; In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.&nbsp; For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.&nbsp; Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".&nbsp; The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.&nbsp; A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control<br>
compilation and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).&nbsp; Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application.&nbsp; Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&nbsp; To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.&nbsp; (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)&nbsp; Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".&nbsp; Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".&nbsp; The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&nbsp; The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.&nbsp; (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.&nbsp; You must supply a copy of this License.&nbsp; If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.&nbsp; Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; executable containing the modified Library.&nbsp; (It is understood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three years, to give the same user the materials specified in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.&nbsp; However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.&nbsp; Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.&nbsp; However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those<br>
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>

&nbsp; If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.&nbsp; You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms<br>
of the ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.<br>
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most<br>
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should<br>
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full<br>
notice is found.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the GNU<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or<br>
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,<br>
if necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Additional Definitions. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.&nbsp; The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.&nbsp; You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.<br>

Component gcc/libbacktrace:<br>
----------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
The libbacktrace library<br>
Initially written by Ian Lance Taylor &lt;iant@google.com&gt;<br>
<br>
The libbacktrace library may be linked into a program or library and <br>
used to produce symbolic backtraces.&nbsp; Sample uses would be to print a<br>
detailed backtrace when an error occurs or to gather detailed<br>
profiling information.<br>
<br>
The libbacktrace library is provided under a BSD license.&nbsp; See the <br>
source files for the exact license text.<br>
<br>
The public functions are declared and documented in the header file<br>
backtrace.h, which should be #include'd by a user of the library.<br>
<br>
Building libbacktrace will generate a file backtrace-supported.h,<br>
which a user of the library may use to determine whether backtraces<br>
will work.&nbsp; See the source file backtrace-supported.h.in for the <br>
macros that it defines.<br>
<br>
As of September 2012, libbacktrace only supports ELF executables with<br>
DWARF debugging information.&nbsp; The library is written to make it<br>
straightforward to add support for other object file and debugging<br>
formats.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.&nbsp; This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.&nbsp; If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.&nbsp; The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp; If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp; A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.&nbsp; This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.&nbsp; In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp; A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp; The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp; Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp; If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.&nbsp; (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp; You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp; If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp; If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.&nbsp; If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp; Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp; However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.&nbsp; These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp; You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp; If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp; For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp; The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp; For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).&nbsp; To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp; The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.&nbsp; However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program.&nbsp; If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;program&gt;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.&nbsp; But first, please read<br>
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Additional Definitions. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.&nbsp; The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.&nbsp; You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2, June 1991<br>

&nbsp;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&nbsp; This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.&nbsp; (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.&nbsp; If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp; The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute corresponding source code.&nbsp; (This alternative is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.&nbsp; However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
&nbsp; `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>
&nbsp; Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br>

<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.&nbsp; This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.&nbsp; If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.&nbsp; The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp; If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp; A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.&nbsp; This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.&nbsp; In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp; A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp; The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp; Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp; If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.&nbsp; (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp; You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp; If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp; If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.&nbsp; If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp; Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp; However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.&nbsp; These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp; You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp; If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp; For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp; The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp; For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).&nbsp; To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp; The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.&nbsp; However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program.&nbsp; If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;program&gt;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.&nbsp; But first, please read<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307&nbsp; USA<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.&nbsp; It is<br>
&nbsp;numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.&nbsp; You can use it for<br>
your libraries, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.&nbsp; If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
library.&nbsp; If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>
the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
transforming the program into proprietary software.&nbsp; To prevent this,<br>
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.&nbsp; This<br>
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
designated libraries.&nbsp; This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>
the same as in the ordinary license.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>
program and simply using it.&nbsp; Linking a program with a library, without<br>
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>
analogous to running a utility program or application program.&nbsp; However, in<br>
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>
treats it as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.&nbsp; We<br>
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
libraries themselves.&nbsp; This Library General Public License is intended to<br>
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>
libraries that are incorporated in them.&nbsp; (We have not seen how to achieve<br>
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)&nbsp; The hope is that this<br>
will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.&nbsp; Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".&nbsp; The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>
works together with the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
General Public License (also called "this License").&nbsp; Each licensee is<br>
addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.&nbsp; A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).&nbsp; Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application.&nbsp; Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&nbsp; To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.&nbsp; (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)&nbsp; Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".&nbsp; Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".&nbsp; The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&nbsp; The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.&nbsp; (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.&nbsp; You must supply a copy of this License.&nbsp; If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.&nbsp; Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; executable containing the modified Library.&nbsp; (It is understood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.&nbsp; However, as a special exception,<br>
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.&nbsp; Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.&nbsp; However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.&nbsp; You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&nbsp; It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the GNU<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License along with this library; if not, write to the Free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307&nbsp; USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
&nbsp; library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.&nbsp; This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.&nbsp; If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.&nbsp; The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp; If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp; A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.&nbsp; This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.&nbsp; In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp; A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp; The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp; Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp; If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.&nbsp; (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp; You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp; If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp; If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.&nbsp; If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp; Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp; However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.&nbsp; These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp; You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp; If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp; For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp; The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp; For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).&nbsp; To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp; The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.&nbsp; However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program.&nbsp; If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;program&gt;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>

<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.&nbsp; But first, please read<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
&nbsp;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.&nbsp; It is<br>
&nbsp;numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.&nbsp; You can use it for<br>
your libraries, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.&nbsp; If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
library.&nbsp; If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>
the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
transforming the program into proprietary software.&nbsp; To prevent this,<br>
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.&nbsp; This<br>
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
designated libraries.&nbsp; This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>
the same as in the ordinary license.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>
program and simply using it.&nbsp; Linking a program with a library, without<br>
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>
analogous to running a utility program or application program.&nbsp; However, in<br>
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>
treats it as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.&nbsp; We<br>
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
libraries themselves.&nbsp; This Library General Public License is intended to<br>
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>
libraries that are incorporated in them.&nbsp; (We have not seen how to achieve<br>
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)&nbsp; The hope is that this<br>
will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.&nbsp; Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".&nbsp; The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>
works together with the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
General Public License (also called "this License").&nbsp; Each licensee is<br>
addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.&nbsp; A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).&nbsp; Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application.&nbsp; Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&nbsp; To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.&nbsp; (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)&nbsp; Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".&nbsp; Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".&nbsp; The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&nbsp; The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.&nbsp; (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.&nbsp; You must supply a copy of this License.&nbsp; If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.&nbsp; Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; executable containing the modified Library.&nbsp; (It is understood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.&nbsp; However, as a special exception,<br>
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.&nbsp; Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.&nbsp; However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.&nbsp; You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&nbsp; It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the GNU<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License along with this library; if not, write to the Free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MA 02110-1301, USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
&nbsp; library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990<br>
&nbsp; Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Additional Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.&nbsp; The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.&nbsp; You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.&nbsp; This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.&nbsp; If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.&nbsp; The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp; If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp; A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.&nbsp; This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.&nbsp; In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp; A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp; The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp; Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp; If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.&nbsp; (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp; You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp; If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp; If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.&nbsp; If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp; Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp; However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.&nbsp; These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp; You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp; If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp; For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp; The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp; For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).&nbsp; To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp; The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.&nbsp; However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program.&nbsp; If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;program&gt;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>

<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.&nbsp; But first, please read<br>
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Additional Definitions. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.&nbsp; The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.&nbsp; You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.&nbsp; This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.&nbsp; If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.&nbsp; The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp; If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp; A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.&nbsp; This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.&nbsp; In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp; A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp; The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp; Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp; If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.&nbsp; (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp; You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp; If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp; If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.&nbsp; If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp; Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp; However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.&nbsp; These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp; You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp; If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp; For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp; The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp; For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).&nbsp; To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp; The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.&nbsp; However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program.&nbsp; If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;program&gt;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>

&nbsp; The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.&nbsp; But first, please read<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.&nbsp; It also counts<br>
&nbsp;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
&nbsp;the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.&nbsp; You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.&nbsp; These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.&nbsp; If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.&nbsp; Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.&nbsp; We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.&nbsp; Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.&nbsp; This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&nbsp; We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.&nbsp; The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.&nbsp; The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.&nbsp; It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.&nbsp; These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.&nbsp; However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.&nbsp; To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.&nbsp; A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&nbsp; In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.&nbsp; For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.&nbsp; Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".&nbsp; The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.&nbsp; A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).&nbsp; Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application.&nbsp; Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&nbsp; To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.&nbsp; (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)&nbsp; Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".&nbsp; Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".&nbsp; The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&nbsp; The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.&nbsp; (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.&nbsp; You must supply a copy of this License.&nbsp; If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.&nbsp; Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; executable containing the modified Library.&nbsp; (It is understood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.&nbsp; However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.&nbsp; Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.&nbsp; However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.&nbsp; You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&nbsp; It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the GNU<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&nbsp; This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.&nbsp; (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.&nbsp; If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp; The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute corresponding source code.&nbsp; (This alternative is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.&nbsp; However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year&nbsp; name of author<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br>

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.&nbsp; It is<br>

<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.&nbsp; You can use it for<br>
your libraries, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.&nbsp; If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
library.&nbsp; If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>
the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
transforming the program into proprietary software.&nbsp; To prevent this,<br>
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.&nbsp; This<br>
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
designated libraries.&nbsp; This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>
the same as in the ordinary license.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>
program and simply using it.&nbsp; Linking a program with a library, without<br>
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>
analogous to running a utility program or application program.&nbsp; However, in<br>
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>
treats it as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.&nbsp; We<br>
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
libraries themselves.&nbsp; This Library General Public License is intended to<br>
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>
libraries that are incorporated in them.&nbsp; (We have not seen how to achieve<br>
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)&nbsp; The hope is that this<br>
will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.&nbsp; Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".&nbsp; The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>
works together with the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
General Public License (also called "this License").&nbsp; Each licensee is<br>
addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.&nbsp; A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).&nbsp; Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application.&nbsp; Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&nbsp; To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.&nbsp; (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)&nbsp; Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".&nbsp; Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".&nbsp; The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&nbsp; The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.&nbsp; (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.&nbsp; You must supply a copy of this License.&nbsp; If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.&nbsp; Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; executable containing the modified Library.&nbsp; (It is understood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.&nbsp; However, as a special exception,<br>
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.&nbsp; Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.&nbsp; However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.&nbsp; You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&nbsp; It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the GNU<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License along with this library; if not, write to the Free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MA 02110-1301, USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
&nbsp; library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Additional Definitions. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.&nbsp; The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.&nbsp; You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.<br>

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION<br>
<br>
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this<br>
license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional<br>
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version<br>
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that<br>
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that<br>
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.<br>
<br>
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of<br>
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled<br>
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of<br>
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the<br>
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.<br>
<br>
0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime<br>
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an<br>
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based<br>
on the Runtime Library.<br>
<br>
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without<br>
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of<br>
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any<br>
subsequent versions published by the FSF.<br>
<br>
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,<br>
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with<br>
the license of GCC.<br>
<br>
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual<br>
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for<br>
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution<br>
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any<br>
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used<br>
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.<br>
<br>
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in<br>
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in<br>
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,<br>
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered<br>
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be<br>
understood as starting with the output of the generators or<br>
preprocessors.<br>
<br>
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or<br>
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any<br>
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to<br>
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an<br>
Eligible Compilation Process.<br>
<br>
1. Grant of Additional Permission.<br>
<br>
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by<br>
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such<br>
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that<br>
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You<br>
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,<br>
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.<br>
<br>
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.<br>
<br>
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general<br>
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft<br>
requirements of the license of GCC.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.&nbsp; This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.&nbsp; If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.&nbsp; The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp; If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp; A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.&nbsp; This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.&nbsp; In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp; A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp; The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp; Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp; If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.&nbsp; (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp; You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp; If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp; If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.&nbsp; If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp; Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp; However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.&nbsp; These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp; You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp; If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp; For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp; The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp; For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).&nbsp; To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp; The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.&nbsp; However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&nbsp; This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.&nbsp; (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.&nbsp; If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp; The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute corresponding source code.&nbsp; (This alternative is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.&nbsp; However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year&nbsp; name of author<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>

&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.&nbsp; It also counts<br>
&nbsp;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
&nbsp;the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.&nbsp; You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations<br>
below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.&nbsp; These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.&nbsp; If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.&nbsp; Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.&nbsp; We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.&nbsp; Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.&nbsp; This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&nbsp; We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.&nbsp; The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.&nbsp; The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.&nbsp; It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.&nbsp; These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.&nbsp; However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it<br>
becomes a de-facto standard.&nbsp; To achieve this, non-free programs must<br>
be allowed to use the library.&nbsp; A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&nbsp; In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.&nbsp; For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.&nbsp; Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".&nbsp; The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.&nbsp; A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control<br>
compilation and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).&nbsp; Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application.&nbsp; Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&nbsp; To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.&nbsp; (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)&nbsp; Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".&nbsp; Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".&nbsp; The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&nbsp; The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.&nbsp; (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.&nbsp; You must supply a copy of this License.&nbsp; If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.&nbsp; Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; executable containing the modified Library.&nbsp; (It is understood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three years, to give the same user the materials specified in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.&nbsp; However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.&nbsp; Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.&nbsp; However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those<br>
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.&nbsp; You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms<br>
of the ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.<br>
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most<br>
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should<br>
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full<br>
notice is found.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the GNU<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02110-1301&nbsp; USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or<br>
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,<br>
if necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
&nbsp; library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Additional Definitions. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.&nbsp; The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.&nbsp; You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.<br>

Component gcc/libbacktrace:<br>
----------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
The libbacktrace library<br>
Initially written by Ian Lance Taylor &lt;iant@google.com&gt;<br>
<br>
The libbacktrace library may be linked into a program or library and <br>
used to produce symbolic backtraces.&nbsp; Sample uses would be to print a<br>
detailed backtrace when an error occurs or to gather detailed<br>
profiling information.<br>
<br>
The libbacktrace library is provided under a BSD license.&nbsp; See the <br>
source files for the exact license text.<br>
<br>
The public functions are declared and documented in the header file<br>
backtrace.h, which should be #include'd by a user of the library.<br>
<br>
Building libbacktrace will generate a file backtrace-supported.h,<br>
which a user of the library may use to determine whether backtraces<br>
will work.&nbsp; See the source file backtrace-supported.h.in for the <br>
macros that it defines.<br>
<br>
As of September 2012, libbacktrace only supports ELF executables with<br>
DWARF debugging information.&nbsp; The library is written to make it<br>
straightforward to add support for other object file and debugging<br>
formats.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.&nbsp; This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.&nbsp; If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.&nbsp; The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp; If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp; A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.&nbsp; This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.&nbsp; In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp; A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp; The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp; Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp; If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.&nbsp; (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp; You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp; If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp; If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.&nbsp; If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp; Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp; However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.&nbsp; These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp; You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp; If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp; For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp; The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp; For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).&nbsp; To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp; The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.&nbsp; However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program.&nbsp; If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;program&gt;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.&nbsp; But first, please read<br>
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Additional Definitions. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.&nbsp; The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.&nbsp; You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>

&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&nbsp; This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.&nbsp; (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.&nbsp; If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp; The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute corresponding source code.&nbsp; (This alternative is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.&nbsp; However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
&nbsp; `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>

<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.&nbsp; This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.&nbsp; If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.&nbsp; The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp; If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp; A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.&nbsp; This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.&nbsp; In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp; A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp; The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp; Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp; If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.&nbsp; (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp; You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp; If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp; If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.&nbsp; If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp; Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp; However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.&nbsp; These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp; You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp; If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp; For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp; The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp; For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).&nbsp; To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp; The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.&nbsp; However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>

<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>

<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307&nbsp; USA<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.&nbsp; It is<br>
&nbsp;numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.&nbsp; You can use it for<br>
your libraries, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.&nbsp; If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
library.&nbsp; If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>
the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
transforming the program into proprietary software.&nbsp; To prevent this,<br>
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.&nbsp; This<br>
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
designated libraries.&nbsp; This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>
the same as in the ordinary license.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>
program and simply using it.&nbsp; Linking a program with a library, without<br>
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>
analogous to running a utility program or application program.&nbsp; However, in<br>
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>
treats it as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.&nbsp; We<br>
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
libraries themselves.&nbsp; This Library General Public License is intended to<br>
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>
libraries that are incorporated in them.&nbsp; (We have not seen how to achieve<br>
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)&nbsp; The hope is that this<br>
will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.&nbsp; Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".&nbsp; The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>
works together with the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
General Public License (also called "this License").&nbsp; Each licensee is<br>
addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.&nbsp; A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).&nbsp; Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application.&nbsp; Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&nbsp; To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.&nbsp; (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)&nbsp; Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".&nbsp; Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".&nbsp; The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&nbsp; The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.&nbsp; (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.&nbsp; You must supply a copy of this License.&nbsp; If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.&nbsp; Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; executable containing the modified Library.&nbsp; (It is understood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.&nbsp; However, as a special exception,<br>
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.&nbsp; Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.&nbsp; However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.&nbsp; You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&nbsp; It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the GNU<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License along with this library; if not, write to the Free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307&nbsp; USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.&nbsp; This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.&nbsp; If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.&nbsp; The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp; If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp; A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.&nbsp; This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.&nbsp; In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp; A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp; The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp; Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp; If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.&nbsp; (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp; You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp; If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp; If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.&nbsp; If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp; Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp; However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.&nbsp; These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp; You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp; If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp; For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp; The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp; For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).&nbsp; To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp; The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.&nbsp; However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program.&nbsp; If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;program&gt;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>

<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.&nbsp; But first, please read<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
&nbsp;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.&nbsp; It is<br>
&nbsp;numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.&nbsp; You can use it for<br>
your libraries, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.&nbsp; If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
library.&nbsp; If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>
the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
transforming the program into proprietary software.&nbsp; To prevent this,<br>
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.&nbsp; This<br>
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
designated libraries.&nbsp; This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>
the same as in the ordinary license.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>
program and simply using it.&nbsp; Linking a program with a library, without<br>
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>
analogous to running a utility program or application program.&nbsp; However, in<br>
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>
treats it as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.&nbsp; We<br>
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
libraries themselves.&nbsp; This Library General Public License is intended to<br>
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>
libraries that are incorporated in them.&nbsp; (We have not seen how to achieve<br>
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)&nbsp; The hope is that this<br>
will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.&nbsp; Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".&nbsp; The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>
works together with the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
General Public License (also called "this License").&nbsp; Each licensee is<br>
addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.&nbsp; A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).&nbsp; Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application.&nbsp; Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&nbsp; To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.&nbsp; (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)&nbsp; Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".&nbsp; Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".&nbsp; The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&nbsp; The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.&nbsp; (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.&nbsp; You must supply a copy of this License.&nbsp; If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.&nbsp; Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; executable containing the modified Library.&nbsp; (It is understood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.&nbsp; However, as a special exception,<br>
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.&nbsp; Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.&nbsp; However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.&nbsp; You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&nbsp; It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the GNU<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License along with this library; if not, write to the Free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MA 02110-1301, USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
&nbsp; library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990<br>
&nbsp; Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
That's all there is to it!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Additional Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.&nbsp; The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.&nbsp; You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.&nbsp; This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.&nbsp; If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.&nbsp; The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp; If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp; A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.&nbsp; This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp; This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.&nbsp; In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp; A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp; The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp; Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp; If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.&nbsp; (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp; You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp; If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp; If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.&nbsp; If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp; Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp; However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.&nbsp; These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp; You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp; If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp; For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp; The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp; For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).&nbsp; To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp; The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.&nbsp; However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program.&nbsp; If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;program&gt;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.&nbsp; But first, please read<br>
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. Additional Definitions. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.&nbsp; The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.&nbsp; You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.<br>
