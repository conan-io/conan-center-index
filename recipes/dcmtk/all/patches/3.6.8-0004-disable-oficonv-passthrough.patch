     if backwards compatibility with ACR-NEMA is desired. If this is
     important, compile with this macro enabled.

+DCMTK_ENABLE_ICONV_PASSTHROUGH
+  Affected: oficonv
+  Type of modification: Activates feature
+  Explanation: If compiled with this macro, the oficonv libary will
+    simply copy input to output during a character set conversion if
+    input and output encoding are the same. This is more efficient, but
+    means that in invalid byte sequences in the source will remain
+    undetected and copied to the target, whereas the default behaviour
+    would detect this and stop the conversion. It is also incompatible
+    with the behaviour of the GNU iconv library.
+    In DCMTK 3.6.8, this feature was always enabled.
+    PATCH(conan-center-index): disabled by default in 3.6.8 as well to 
+    avoid regression https://support.dcmtk.org/redmine/issues/1143
