## ✅ Next Step

Let’s now begin functionality-by-functionality, and for each:

1. **Explain the logic**
2. **Explain new syntax**
3. **Implement it**
4. **Test with `main.cpp`**

Shall we go ahead with the **`getFrequency<T>` function** (to count how many times each item appears in a vector)?  
It’s very useful in CP and a good way to introduce `template`, `map`, and iteration.

Type `yes` or `start` and I’ll walk you through line by line.
