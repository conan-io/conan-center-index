Subject: [PATCH] Require directx-headers when building wsi_common_win32.cpp

The src/vulkan/wsi/wsi_common_win32.cpp file includes directx/d3d12.h, but does not always link directx-headers.
This is problematic when attempting to build the swrast Vulkan driver without one of with_gallium_d3d12, with_microsoft_cl, with_microsoft_vk.
It may also be problematic when attempting to build the zink Gallium driver without one of those.
This commit fixes the checks for the directx-headers dependency to be required in these additional situations where wsi_common_win32.cpp is compiled.
