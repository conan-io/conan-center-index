# The sources for this project get deleted from time to time.
# We use the backup sources from Conan Center as mirrors to let users compile in the future
# When adding new versions, directly add the URL following previous versions schema
# https://c3i.jfrog.io/artifactory/conan-center-backup-sources/ + sha256 of the sources
# The file will be automatically uploaded after the first successful compilation of the new version
# And will be usable as a mirror from then on.
# At some point the Conan client might come pre-configured with this backup remote by default, but don't delete the links then
# some users might still rely on the old revisions/not have it set to point to our CCI backup remote
