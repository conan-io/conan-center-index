# INFO: Upstream moved to rolling releases and removed all tarballs.
#       The Github mirror (https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT) does not match the checksums and have missing header files.
#       Conan will consume the backup sources from the Conan Center Artifactory instead, which are the original tarballs (same checksums).
#       Read the issue https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/issues/25032 for more information.
