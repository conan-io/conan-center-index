## Community

Conan Center Index is an Open Source MIT licensed project.
Conan Center Index is developed by the Conan maintainers and a great community of contributors.

## Dev-flow & Pull Requests

CCI follows the ["GitFlow"](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) branching model.
Issues are triaged and categorized mainly by type (package request, bug...) and priority (high, medium...) using GitHub
 labels.

To contribute follow the next steps:

1. Comment in the corresponding issue that you want to contribute the package/fix proposed. If there is no open issue, we strongly suggest
   to open one to gather feedback.
2. Check the [how_to_add_packages.md](how_to_add_packages.md) if are
   contributing for a new package.
3. Fork the [CCI repository](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index) and create a `package/xxx` branch from the `master` branch and develop
   your fix/packages as discussed in previous step.
4. Try to keep your branch updated with the `master` branch to avoid conflicts.
5. Add the text (besides other comments): "fixes #IssueNumber" in the body of the PR, referring to the issue of step 1.

The ``conan-io`` organization maintainers will review and help with the packaging.

## Issues

If you think you found a bug in CCI or in a recipe, open an issue indicating the following:
