# Preparing recipes for Conan 2.0

As you may know, [Conan 2.0-alpha is already
released](https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/2.0.0-alpha1). Although Conan
Center Index will keep on running with Conan 1.X for a long time, we want to anticipate to
the migration and start making changes in recipes so that they are as much compatible as
possible with Conan 2.0 and make the change easier when the time comes. 

For more information about Conan 2.0 and things that change to respect to Conan 1.X,
please read the [migration guide](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/conan_v2.html) in the
Conan documentation.

This document is a practical guide covering the necessary changes to Conan Center Index
recipes to be ready to upgrade to Conan 2.0:

## Contents

  * [Adding cpp_info set_property](#new-cpp_info-set_property-model)
    * [The Build Service](#the-build-service)<!-- endToc -->

## New cpp_info set_property model

New Conan generators, like
[CMakeDeps](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/cmake/cmakedeps.html)
and
[PkgConfigDeps](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/gnu/pkgconfigdeps.html)
don't listen to *cpp_info* ``.names``, ``.filenames`` or ``.build_modules`` attributes.
There is a new way of setting the *cpp_info* information for consumers that use these
generators via the ``set_property(property_name, value)`` method.

This means that all the information in the recipes that was set with the legacy model
should be translated to the new model. These two models **will live together in recipes** to
make recipes compatible **with both new and legacy generators** for some time. After an stable Conan 2.0
version is released and when the moment arrives that we don't support legacy generators
any more in Conan Center Index, the ``.names``, ``.filenames`` or ``.build_modules``
attributes will be removed and only ``set_property`` methods will remain.

We will cover different practical cases of porting all the information set with legacy
model to the new one. If you want to read more about the properties available for each
generator and how the new properties model work, please check the [Conan
documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/conan_v2.html#editables-don-t-use-external-templates-any-more-new-layout-model).

> ⚠️ **Note**: Please, remember that the **new** ``set_property`` and the **legacy** attributes
> model are *completely independent since Conan 1.43*. Setting ``set_property`` in recipes will
> not affect legacy generators (``cmake``, ``cmake_multi``, ``cmake_find_package`` and
> ``cmake_find_package_multi``) at all.

### Update required_conan_version to ">=1.43.0"

If you are setting the property ``cmake_target_name`` in the recipe, the Conan minimum
required version should be updated to 1.43. 

```python

required_conan_version = ">=1.43.0"

class GdalConan(ConanFile):
    name = "gdal"
    ...
```

The reason is that before Conan 1.43 the
``cmake_target_name`` values were interpreted as a part of the names of the targets for
CMake and Conan added namespaces automatically to these target names. After 1.43
``cmake_target_name`` sets the **complete target name** that is added to the ``.cmake`` files
generated by Conan. Let's see an example:

```python
class GdalConan(ConanFile):
    name = "gdal"
    ...
    def package_info(self):
        # Before 1.43 -> Conan adds GDAL:: namespace -> Creates target with name GDAL::GDAL
        self.cpp_info.set_property("cmake_target_name", "GDAL")

        # After 1.43 -> Conan creates target with name GDAL::GDAL
        self.cpp_info.set_property("cmake_target_name", "GDAL::GDAL")
```

### Translating .names information

The ``.names`` attribute can affect both the generated CMake target names and the
filenames of the ``Find<pkg>.cmake`` or ``<pkg>-config.cmake`` files that store the
dependencies information. That is because if the ``.filenames`` attribute is not set it
will fall back on the ``.names`` value to generate the files.

### Translating .filenames information

### Set cmake_find_mode to both
