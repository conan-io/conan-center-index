# Code of conduct

Try to be polite, CCI maintainers and contributors are really willing to help and we enjoy it.

Please keep in mind these points:

- There are limited resources/time and not all issues/pull requests can be considered as well as we would like.
- ``conan-io`` maintainers can tag/close/modify any opened issue and it should not be interpreted as a rude or disrespectful action. It
  **always** responds to organizational purposes. A closed issue can be perfectly reopened or further commented.
- It is very hard to keep the project in good health in terms of technical debt, usability, serviceability, etc. If the proposed feature is
  not clearly stated, enough information is not provided or it is not sure that would be a good feature for the future development of the project, it won't be accepted. The community plays a very important role during this discussion so it strongly encouraged to
  explain the value of a feature for the community, the needed documentation and its use cases.
- Backwards compatibility and not breaking users' packages is very important and it won't be done unless there are very good reasons.
- You should not get bothered if you feel unattended, CCI is an Open Source project, not a commercial product. Try to explain what you
  really need and we will try to help you.
  
 For possible violations of the CoC, please report to info@conan.io **and** conancenter@jfrog.com
