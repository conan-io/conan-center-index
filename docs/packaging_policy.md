# Packaging Policy

This document gathers all the relevant information regarding the general lines to follow while creating new recipes that will eventually be
part of this repository.

## Sources

- Recipes should build packages from library sources.

- Library sources should come from an official origin like the library source code repository or the official release/download webpage.
  Source forks or unofficial origin of sources are not allowed.

- If library sources cannot be downloaded from their official origin or cannot be consumed directly due to their format, an issue should be
  opened in order to discuss alternative solutions.

- Library sources that are not publicly available will not be allowed in this repository even if the license allows their redistribution.

- In the remote case of having to package precompiled libraries, those should come from official sources like release/download webpages.
