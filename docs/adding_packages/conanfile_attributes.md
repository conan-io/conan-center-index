# `ConanFile` Attributes

The `ConanFile` class has a lot of different properties that can help consumers search for projects, help the client build packages for different configurations
or are known by ConanCenter's build service and have special meaning.

## Order of methods and attributes

Prefer the following order of documented methods in python code (`conanfile.py`, `test_package/conanfile.py`):

For `conan create` the order is listed [here](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/creator/create.html#methods-execution-order)
test packages recipes should append the following methods:

- deploy
- test

the order above resembles the execution order of methods on CI. therefore, for instance, `build` is always executed before `package` method, so `build` should appear before the
`package` in `conanfile.py`.

## License Attribute

The mandatory license attribute of each recipe **should** be a [SPDX license](https://spdx.org/licenses/) [short Identifiers](https://spdx.dev/ids/) when applicable.

Where the SPDX guidelines do not apply, packages should do the following:

- When no license is provided or it's under the ["public domain"](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/) - these are not a license by itself. Thus, we have [equivalent licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain-equivalent_license) that should be used instead. If a project fall under these criteria it should be identified as the [Unlicense](https://spdx.org/licenses/Unlicense) license.
- When a custom (e.g. project specific) license is given, the value should be set to `LicenseRef-` as a prefix, followed by the name of the file which contains the custom license. See [this example](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/blob/e604534bbe0ef56bdb1f8513b83404eff02aebc8/recipes/fft/all/conanfile.py#L8). For more details, [read this conversation](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/pull/4928/files#r596216206).


## Settings

All recipes should list the four settings `os`, `arch`, `compiler` and `build_type` so Conan will compute a different package ID
for each combination. There are some particular cases for this general rule:

* **Recipes for _header only_ libraries** might omit the `settings` attribute, but in any case they should add

   ```python
   def package_id(self):
      self.info.clear()
   ```

* **Recipes that provide applications** (`b2`, `cmake`, `make`,...) that are generally used as a _build requires_, must list all
   the settings as well, but they should remove the `compiler` one in the corresponding method unless the recipe provides also
   libraries that are consumed by other packages:

   ```python
   def package_id(self):
      del self.info.settings.compiler
   ```

   Removing the `compiler` setting reduces the number of configurations generated by the CI, reducing the time and workload and, at the
   same time, demonstrates the power of Conan behind the package ID logic.

   > **Note** Intentionally, the `build_type` setting should not be removed from the package ID in this case. Preserving this
   > setting will ensure that the package ID for Debug and Release configurations will be different and both binaries can be
   > available in the Conan cache at the same time. This enable consumers to switch from one configuration to the other in the case
   > they want to run or to debug those executables.

## Options

Recipes can list any number of options with any meaning, and defaults are up to the recipe itself. The CI cannot enforce anything
in this direction. However, there are a couple of options that have a special meaning for the CI.

### Recommended Names

Adding options is often needed to toggle specific library features on/off. Regardless of the default, there is a strong preference for using positive naming for options. In order to avoid the fragmentation, we recommend using the following naming conventions for such options:

- enable_<feature> / disable_<feature>
- with_<dependency> / without_<dependency>
- use_<feature>

The actual recipe code then may look like:

```py
    options = {"enable_locales": [True, False]} # Changes which files are compiled in to the library
    default_options = {"enable_locales": True}
```

```py
    options = {"with_zlib": [True, False]} # Will add a `self.requires` with more deps to link against
    default_options = {"with_zlib": True}
```

```py
    options = {"use_tzdb": [True, False]} # Might install more headers to expose more features
    default_options = {"use_tzdb": True}
```

Having the same naming conventions for the options helps consumers. It allows users to specify options with wildcards: `-o *:with_threads=True`. Therefore, the `with_threads` options will be enabled for all packages in the graph that support it.

### Predefined Options and Known Defaults

ConanCenter supports many combinations, these are outline in the [supported configurations](../supported_platforms_and_configurations.md) document for each platform.
By default recipes should use `shared=False` with `fPIC=True`. If support, `header_only=False` is the default.

Usage of each option should follow the rules:

* `shared` (with values `True` or `False`). The CI inspects the recipe looking for this option. The **default should be `shared=False`** and will
   generate all the configurations with values `shared=True` and `shared=False`.

   > **Note**: The CI applies `shared=True` only to the package being built, while every other requirement will `shared=False`. To consume everything as a shared library you will set `--build=always` and/or `-o *:shared=True`)
   > It's important to keep this in mind when trying to consume shared packages from ConanCenter
   > as their requirements were linked inside the shared library. See [FAQs](../faqs.md#how-to-consume-a-graph-of-shared-libraries) for more information.

* `fPIC` (with values `True` or `False`). The **default should be `fPIC=True`** and will generate all the configurations with values `fPIC=True` and `fPIC=False`.
  This option does not make sense on all the support configurations so it should be removed.

   ```python
    def config_options(self):
        if self.settings.os == "Windows":
            del self.options.fPIC

   def configure(self):
      if self.options.shared:
         self.options.rm_safe("fPIC")
   ```

* `header_only` (with values `True` or `False`). The **default should be `header_only=False`**. If the CI detects this option, it will generate all the
   configurations for the value `header_only=False` and add one more configuration with `header_only=True`. **Only one package**
   will be generated for `header_only=True`, so it is crucial that the package is actually a _header only_ library, with header files only (no libraries or executables inside).

   Recipes with such option should include the following in their `package_id` method

   ```python
   def package_id(self):
      if self.options.header_only:
         self.info.clear()
   ```

   ensuring that, when the option is active, the recipe ignores all the settings and only one package ID is generated.

### Options to Avoid

* `build_testing` should not be added, nor any other related unit test option. Options affect the package ID, therefore, testing should not be part of that.
   Instead, use Conan config [skip_test](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/config_files/global_conf.html#tools-configurations) feature:

   ```python
   def generate(self):
      tc = CMakeToolChain(self)
      tc.variables['BUILD_TESTING'] = not self.conf.get("tools.build:skip_test", default=true, check_type=bool)
   ```

   The `skip_test` configuration is supported by [CMake](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/build_helpers/cmake.html#test) and [Meson](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/build_helpers/meson.html#test).
