# ConanCenterIndex Linters

Some linter configuration files are available in the folder [linter](../linter), which are executed by Github Actions
and are displayed during [code review](https://github.com/features/code-review) as annotations, to improve recipe quality.
They consume python scripts which are executed to fit CCI rules. Those scripts use [astroid](https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid)
and [pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/) classes to parse Conan recipe files and manage their warnings and errors.

Pylint by itself is not able to find ConanCenterIndex rules, so astroid is used to iterate over a conanfile's content and
validate CCI requirements. Pylint uses an [rcfile](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/configuration/index.html)
to configure plugins, warnings and errors which should be enabled or disabled.

## Understanding the different linters

There's a three classes of linters currently in place for ConanCenterIndex

- ConanCenter Hook - these are responsible for validating the structure of the recipes and packages.
- Pylint Linter - these are used to ensure the code quality and conventions of a recipes (i.e `conanfile.py`)
- Yaml Checks - stylistic guidance and schema validation check for support files and best practices

## Running the linters locally

Check the [Developing Recipes](developing_recipes_locally.md) for more information on each of the three linters.

## Pylint configuration files

- [Pylint Recipe](../linter/pylintrc_recipe): This `rcfile` lists plugins and rules to be executed over all recipes (not test package) and validate them.
- [Pylint Test Package Recipe](../linter/pylintrc_testpackage): This `rcfile` lists plugins and rules to be executed over all recipes in test package folders only:

## Linter Warning and Errors

Here is the list of current warning and errors provided by pylint, when using CCI configuration.

### E9006 - conan-import-conanfile: ConanFile should be imported from conan

```python
from conans import ConanFile
```

Should be replaced by:

```python
from conan import Conanfile
```

### E9005 - conan-missing-name: Every conan recipe must contain the attribute name

The attribute `name` is always expected. On the other hand, `version` should not be listed.

```python
def BazConanfile(ConanFile):
    name = "baz"
```

### E9004 - conan-package-name: Conan package names must be lower-case

The package name is always lower-case, even when the upstream uses another format

```python
def FoobarConanfile(ConanFile):
    name = "foobar"
```

### E9007 - conan-test-no-name: Do not add name attribute in test package recipes

The test package is not a recipe, thus, it should not have a name

```python
def TestPackageConanFile(ConanFile):
    name = "test_package" # Wrong!
```

### E9008 - conan-import-errors: Deprecated imports should be replaced by new imports

Read [v2_linter](v2_linter.md) for a list of mappings of v1 to v2.
Regular imports from `conans.tools` are now updated:

```python
from conans import tools
...

tools.rmdir(os.path.join(self.package_folder, "shared"))
```

Should be replaced by specialized tools, prepared for Conan 2.0

```python
from conan.tools.files import rmdir
...

rmdir(self, os.path.join(self.package_folder, "shared"))
```

### E9009 - conan-import-error-conanexception: conans.errors is deprecated and conan.errors should be used instead

```python
from conans.errors import ConanException
```

Should be replaced by:

```python
from conan.errors import ConanException
```

Only the namespace `conans` has been replaced by `conan`.

### E9010 - conan-import-error-conaninvalidconfiguration: conans.errors is deprecated and conan.errors should be used instead

```python
from conans.errors import ConanInvalidConfiguration
```

Should be replaced by:

```python
from conan.errors import ConanInvalidConfiguration
```

Only the namespace `conans` has been replaced by `conan`.

### E9011 - conan-import-tools: Importing conan.tools or conan.tools.xxx.zzz.yyy should be considered as private

Documented on [conanfile.tools](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools.html):
It's not allowed to use `tools.xxx` directly:

```python
from conan import tools
...

tools.scm.Version(self.version)
```

Neither sub modules:

```python
from conan.tools.apple.apple import is_apple_os
```

Only modules under `conan.tools` and `conan.tools.xxx` are allowed:

```python
from conan.tools.files import rmdir
from conan.tools import scm
````
