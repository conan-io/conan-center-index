# Conan Center Index - Recipe Watchers
#
# If you are interested to watch/subscribe any recipe from Conan Center Index and receive
# a notification when a new PR is created, add the recipe repo and your @<githubuser>,
# for instance:
#
# recipes/zlib @myusername
#
# NOTE: Github uses case-sensitive filesystem, so your name must be the same from your account.
#
# Github will add you as a reviewer and will notify you by e-mail.
# This feature is named 'CodeOwners', however, it's a Github's feature name.
# On Conan Center Index, there are no owners/maintainers, all recipes are owned by the
# community. This feature only helps people that are more interested in watching and following
# specific recipes, instead of receiving a new notification for each new pull request.
